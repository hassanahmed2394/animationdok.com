      <h4>REVISION POLICY</h4>
      <p>We provide revision depending upon the package you selected. Customers can ask us for unlimited free revisions and we will revise their design without any additional charges provided that the design and concept remains the same. At any point if you'd want to convert the animation style then there'll be an additional fee which cohesively depends on the scope of your animation, For example, if you opted for a white-board video and after seeing its storyboard you change your mind and switch to 2D animation then the policy will be implied automatically. Revision Turnaround Time varies with the phase in which the changes are taking place, here is a breakdown:</p>

      <p><b>Script revisions:</b> 2-3 business days</p>
      <p><b>Voice-over revisions:</b> 2-3 business days</p>
      <p><b>Storyboard design revisions:</b> 3-4 business days</p>
      <p><b>Animation revisions:</b> 3-5 business days</p>

      <h4>Refund Policy / Money Back Guarantee</h4>
      <p>n any event, any deposited funds for a project shall not be subject to refund after revisions or approval is provided on the storyboard design unless Animation Dokâ„¢ cancels or terminates your Contract for a reason other than your breach or non-performance. For all website orders, any request for a refund becomes null & void once all the website design layouts are approved.</p>
