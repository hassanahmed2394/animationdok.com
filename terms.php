      <h4>REVISION POLICY</h4>
      <p>We provide revision depending upon the package you selected. Customers can ask us for unlimited free revisions and we will revise their design without any additional charges provided that the design and concept remains the same. At any point if you'd want to convert the animation style then there'll be an additional fee which cohesively depends on the scope of your animation, For example, if you opted for a white-board video and after seeing its storyboard you change your mind and switch to 2D animation then the policy will be implied automatically. Revision Turnaround Time varies with the phase in which the changes are taking place, here is a breakdown:</p>

      <p><b>Script revisions:</b> 2-3 business days</p>
      <p><b>Voice-over revisions:</b> 2-3 business days</p>
      <p><b>Storyboard design revisions:</b> 3-4 business days</p>
      <p><b>Animation revisions:</b> 3-5 business days</p>

      <h4>Refund Policy / Money Back Guarantee</h4>
